OS-X-Dev-Environment
====================

Notes on creating an OS X native development environment. My primary goals were
to be able to do Drupal 8 development with Xdebug support, which meant that MAMPwasn't a viable option. I also wanted to do work in Ruby and make another shot at getting an Xcode environment for Arudino development going. A secondary goal was to have something easier to understand than Mark Sonnabaum's Megalodon. Megalodon is where I'd like to end up, but when it breaks there is a lot to sort out. I was hoping for something with less of an initial learning curve.
